# Congested clique routing
Implementation of the [Optimal Deterministic Routing algorithm on the Congested Clique](https://people.mpi-inf.mpg.de/~clenzen/pubs/L13optimal.pdf) 

## Getting started

Compile the program using at least C++17 standard e.g.

```console
c++ --std=c++17 ./main.cpp
```

Executing the compiled output will run several tests on both hardcoded and randomly generated inputs (see main.cpp).
